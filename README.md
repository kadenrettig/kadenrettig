# Hi there, I’m Kaden Rettig 🐌

## About Me: 🌻

I am a senior CS Undergraduate student studying at **Clemson University**. </br>
I'm currently working as a member of **Clemson Computing & Information Technology**.

I love learning about new technologies and very much enjoy helping people. </br>

I also adore music; exploring new genres & observing the subtleties of what I already listen to is what I enjoy most.

Currently learning about API's & networking protocols. 🎍
